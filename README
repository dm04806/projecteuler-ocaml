This is a collection of solutions to the projecteuler.net problems using OCaml.
Unless otherwise noted, each solution was written by Kevin Ballard <kevin@sb.org>.

To run each problem, simply execute `ocaml prob##.ml` where ## is the number of the problem.
Note that some problems rely on the Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation, which must be
compiled first using `make sieve.cma`.
